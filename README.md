# Advent of Code 2019

## About

These challenges are being implemented with [dotty](http://dotty.epfl.ch) using worksheets and functional programming libraries such as [ZIO](https://zio.dev) and [spire](https://typelevel.org/spire/) to lift IO operations and work with numerics.

### Usage

`sbt launchIDE` to open vscode and then navigate to the challenge worksheets in `src/main/scala`, files ending in `.sc`. There should be a clickable text displayed by the editor: `Run this worksheet`. Or else activate the worksheet on save.
